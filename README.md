Wallpapers for Flipper Zero

## Jan 5th update:  HAPPY NEW YEARS Flipper peeps!!

All wallpapers are now working!
Reworked almost all the previous meta files, adjusting active / passive frames, cycles and frame rates.  Some are the same as before, some look better, and some turned out way better.  

Added 3 new wallpapers:
CyberPunk23_128x64
CyberPunk24_128x64
CyberPunkLogo_128x64

Copy manifest entries into your exisitng manifest file.

Moving forward, I plan to slowely add more wallpapers, while looking to produce finer quality results.  I am looking into branching out of CyberPunk 2077 specifically, but will stay in the CyberPunk realm all together :)

Enjoy!


## Instructions
1. Download the files, the BMs need to go into your SD Card > dolphin folder.
2. Open the manifest file here, and combine it with your existing manifest file in SD Card/
3. Reboot your flipper, cycle through to view wallpapers.

The PNGs are really not needed, just there for your convenience :)
