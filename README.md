Wallpapers for Flipper Zero

Work in progress, working on CyberPunk Edgerunner wallpaper for Flipper Zero.

Copy manifest entries into your exisitng manifest file.

NOTE:  There are specific ones that do not seem to work yet, I am continueing to look into. All work fine, except the following as of now:

Cyberpunk14_128x64\
Cyberpunk23_128x64


Still need to go in and tweak most of the active / passive frames.  Some look great as of now, some don't.
